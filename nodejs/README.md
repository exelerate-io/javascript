# `1. Project Structure Practices`

## ![✔] 1.1 Structure your solution by components

**TL;DR:** The worst large applications pitfall is maintaining a huge code base with hundreds of dependencies - such a monolith slows down developers as they try to incorporate new features. Instead, partition your code into components, each gets its folder or a dedicated codebase, and ensure that each unit is kept small and simple. Visit 'Read More' below to see examples of correct project structure

<img src="../assets/structure.png" alt="Project structure"/>

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 1.2 Wrap common utilities as npm packages

**TL;DR:** In a large app that constitutes a large codebase, cross-cutting-concern utilities like a logger, encryption and alike, should be wrapped by your code and exposed as private npm packages. This allows sharing them among multiple codebases and projects

**Otherwise:** You'll have to invent your deployment and the dependency wheel


<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 1.3 Use environment aware, secure and hierarchical config

**TL;DR:** A perfect and flawless configuration setup should ensure (a) keys can be read from file AND from environment variable (b) secrets are kept outside committed code (c) config is hierarchical for easier findability. There are a few packages that can help tick most of those boxes like [rc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rc), [nconf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nconf), [config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/config), and [convict](https://www.npmjs.com/package/convict).

**Otherwise:** Failing to satisfy any of the config requirements will simply bog down the development or DevOps team. Probably both


<br/><br/><br/>

# `2. Error Handling Practices`

## ![✔] 2.1 Use Async-Await or promises for async error handling

**TL;DR:** Handling async errors in callback style is probably the fastest way to hell (a.k.a the pyramid of doom). The best gift you can give to your code is using a reputable promise library or async-await instead which enables a much more compact and familiar code syntax like try-catch

**Otherwise:** Node.js callback style, function(err, response), is a promising way to un-maintainable code due to the mix of error handling with casual code, excessive nesting, and awkward coding patterns

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 2.2 Use only the built-in Error object

**TL;DR:** Many throw errors as a string or as some custom type – this complicates the error handling logic and the interoperability between modules. Whether you reject a promise, throw an exception or emit an error – using only the built-in Error object (or an object that extends the built-in Error object) will increase uniformity and prevent loss of information. There is `no-throw-literal` ESLint rule that strictly checks that (although it have some [limitations](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-throw-literal) which can be solved when using TypeScript and setting the `@typescript-eslint/no-throw-literal` rule)

**Otherwise:** When invoking some component, being uncertain which type of errors come in return – it makes proper error handling much harder. Even worse, using custom types to describe errors might lead to loss of critical error information like the stack trace!


<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 2.3 Distinguish operational vs programmer errors


## ![✔] 2.4 Handle errors centrally, not within a middleware

**TL;DR:** Error handling logic such as mail to admin and logging should be encapsulated in a dedicated and centralized object that all endpoints (e.g. Express middleware, cron jobs, unit-testing) call when an error comes in

**Otherwise:** Not handling errors within a single place will lead to code duplication and probably to improperly handled errors

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 2.5 Document API errors using Swagger or GraphQL

**TL;DR:** Let your API callers know which errors might come in return so they can handle these thoughtfully without crashing. For RESTful APIs, this is usually done with documentation frameworks like Swagger. If you're using GraphQL, you can utilize your schema and comments as well.

**Otherwise:** An API client might decide to crash and restart only because it received back an error it couldn’t understand. Note: the caller of your API might be you (very typical in a microservice environment)

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 2.7 Use a mature logger to increase error visibility

**TL;DR:** A set of mature logging tools like [Pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino) or [Log4js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/log4js), will speed-up error discovery and understanding. So forget about console.log

**Otherwise:** Skimming through console.logs or manually through messy text file without querying tools or a decent log viewer might keep you busy at work until late

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 2.10 Catch unhandled promise rejections

**TL;DR:** Any exception thrown within a promise will get swallowed and discarded unless a developer didn’t forget to explicitly handle it. Even if your code is subscribed to `process.uncaughtException`! Overcome this by registering to the event `process.unhandledRejection`

**Otherwise:** Your errors will get swallowed and leave no trace. Nothing to worry about

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 2.11 Fail fast, validate arguments using a dedicated library

**TL;DR:** Assert API input to avoid nasty bugs that are much harder to track later. The validation code is usually tedious unless you are using a very cool helper library like [ajv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ajv) and [Joi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/joi)

**Otherwise:** Consider this – your function expects a numeric argument “Discount” which the caller forgets to pass, later on, your code checks if Discount!=0 (amount of allowed discount is greater than zero), then it will allow the user to enjoy a discount. OMG, what a nasty bug. Can you see it?

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 2.12 Always await promises before returning to avoid a partial stacktrace

**TL;DR:** Always do `return await` when returning a promise to benefit full error stacktrace. If a
function returns a promise, that function must be declared as `async` function and explicitly
`await` the promise before returning it

**Otherwise:** The function that returns a promise without awaiting won't appear in the stacktrace.
Such missing frames would probably complicate the understanding of the flow that leads to the error,
especially if the cause of the abnormal behavior is inside of the missing function

<br/><br/><br/>

<p align="right"><a href="#table-of-contents">⬆ Return to top</a></p>

# `3. Code Style Practices`

## ![✔] 3.1 Use ESLint

**TL;DR:** [ESLint](https://eslint.org) is the de-facto standard for checking possible code errors and fixing code style, not only to identify nitty-gritty spacing issues but also to detect serious code anti-patterns like developers throwing errors without classification. Though ESLint can automatically fix code styles, other tools like [prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier) and [beautify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-beautify) are more powerful in formatting the fix and work in conjunction with ESLint

**Otherwise:** Developers will focus on tedious spacing and line-width concerns and time might be wasted overthinking the project's code style

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 3.3 Start a Codeblock's Curly Braces on the Same Line

**TL;DR:** The opening curly braces of a code block should be on the same line as the opening statement

### Code Example

```javascript
// Do
function someFunction() {
  // code block
}

// Avoid
function someFunction() 
{
  // code block
}
```

**Otherwise:** Deferring from this best practice might lead to unexpected results, as seen in the StackOverflow thread below:

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 3.4 Separate your statements properly

No matter if you use semicolons or not to separate your statements, knowing the common pitfalls of improper linebreaks or automatic semicolon insertion, will help you to eliminate regular syntax errors.

**TL;DR:** Use ESLint to gain awareness about separation concerns. [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) or [Standardjs](https://standardjs.com/) can automatically resolve these issues.

**Otherwise:** As seen in the previous section, JavaScript's interpreter automatically adds a semicolon at the end of a statement if there isn't one, or considers a statement as not ended where it should, which might lead to some undesired results. You can use assignments and avoid using immediately invoked function expressions to prevent most of the unexpected errors.

### Code example

```javascript
// Do
function doThing() {
    // ...
}

doThing()

// Do

const items = [1, 2, 3]
items.forEach(console.log)

// Avoid — throws exception
const m = new Map()
const a = [1,2,3]
[...m.values()].forEach(console.log)
> [...m.values()].forEach(console.log)
>  ^^^
> SyntaxError: Unexpected token ...

// Avoid — throws exception
const count = 2 // it tries to run 2(), but 2 is not a function
(function doSomething() {
  // do something amazing
}())
// put a semicolon before the immediate invoked function, after the const definition, save the return value of the anonymous function to a variable or avoid IIFEs altogether
```


<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 3.5 Name your functions

**TL;DR:** Name all functions, including closures and callbacks. Avoid anonymous functions. This is especially useful when profiling a node app. Naming all functions will allow you to easily understand what you're looking at when checking a memory snapshot

**Otherwise:** Debugging production issues using a core dump (memory snapshot) might become challenging as you notice significant memory consumption from anonymous functions

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 3.6 Use naming conventions for variables, constants, functions and classes

**TL;DR:** Use **_lowerCamelCase_** when naming constants, variables and functions, **_UpperCamelCase_** (capital first letter as well) when naming classes and **_UPPER_SNAKE_CASE_** when naming global or static variables. This will help you to easily distinguish between plain variables, functions, classes that require instantiation and variables declared at global module scope. Use descriptive names, but try to keep them short

**Otherwise:** JavaScript is the only language in the world that allows invoking a constructor ("Class") directly without instantiating it first. Consequently, Classes and function-constructors are differentiated by starting with UpperCamelCase

### 3.6 Code Example

```javascript
// for global variables names we use the const/let keyword and UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
let MUTABLE_GLOBAL = "mutable value"
const GLOBAL_CONSTANT = "immutable value";
const CONFIG = {
  key: "value",
};

// examples of UPPER_SNAKE_CASE convetion in nodejs/javascript ecosystem
// in javascript Math.PI module
const PI = 3.141592653589793;

// https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/b9f36062d7b5c5039498e98d2f2c180dca2a7065/lib/internal/http2/core.js#L303
// in nodejs http2 module
const HTTP_STATUS_OK = 200;
const HTTP_STATUS_CREATED = 201;

// for class name we use UpperCamelCase
class SomeClassExample {
  // for static class properties we use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
  static STATIC_PROPERTY = "value";
}

// for functions names we use lowerCamelCase
function doSomething() {
  // for scoped variable names we use the const/let keyword and lowerCamelCase
  const someConstExample = "immutable value";
  let someMutableExample = "mutable value";
}
```

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 3.7 Prefer const over let. Ditch the var

**TL;DR:** Using `const` means that once a variable is assigned, it cannot be reassigned. Preferring `const` will help you to not be tempted to use the same variable for different uses, and make your code clearer. If a variable needs to be reassigned, in a for loop, for example, use `let` to declare it. Another important aspect of `let` is that a variable declared using it is only available in the block scope in which it was defined. `var` is function scoped, not block-scoped, and [shouldn't be used in ES6](https://hackernoon.com/why-you-shouldnt-use-var-anymore-f109a58b9b70) now that you have `const` and `let` at your disposal

**Otherwise:** Debugging becomes way more cumbersome when following a variable that frequently changes


<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 3.8 Require modules first, not inside functions

**TL;DR:** Require modules at the beginning of each file, before and outside of any functions. This simple best practice will not only help you easily and quickly tell the dependencies of a file right at the top but also avoids a couple of potential problems

**Otherwise:** Requires are run synchronously by Node.js. If they are called from within a function, it may block other requests from being handled at a more critical time. Also, if a required module or any of its dependencies throw an error and crash the server, it is best to find out about it as soon as possible, which might not be the case if that module is required from within a function

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 3.9 Require modules by folders, as opposed to the files directly

**TL;DR:** When developing a module/library in a folder, place an index.js file that exposes the module's internals so every consumer will pass through it. This serves as an 'interface' to your module and eases future changes without breaking the contract

**Otherwise:** Changing the internal structure of files or the signature may break the interface with clients

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 3.10 Use the `===` operator

**TL;DR:** Prefer the strict equality operator `===` over the weaker abstract equality operator `==`. `==` will compare two variables after converting them to a common type. There is no type conversion in `===`, and both variables must be of the same type to be equal

**Otherwise:** Unequal variables might return true when compared with the `==` operator

### 3.10 Code example

```javascript
"" == "0"; // false
0 == ""; // true
0 == "0"; // true

false == "false"; // false
false == "0"; // true

false == undefined; // false
false == null; // false
null == undefined; // true

" \t\r\n " == 0; // true
```

All statements above will return false if used with `===`

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 3.11 Use Async Await, avoid callbacks

**TL;DR:** Node 8 LTS now has full support for Async-await. This is a new way of dealing with asynchronous code which supersedes callbacks and promises. Async-await is non-blocking, and it makes asynchronous code look synchronous. The best gift you can give to your code is using async-await which provides a much more compact and familiar code syntax like try-catch

**Otherwise:** Handling async errors in callback style are probably the fastest way to hell - this style forces to check errors all over, deal with awkward code nesting, and makes it difficult to reason about the code flow


<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 3.12 Use arrow function expressions (=>)

**TL;DR:** Though it's recommended to use async-await and avoid function parameters when dealing with older APIs that accept promises or callbacks - arrow functions make the code structure more compact and keep the lexical context of the root function (i.e. `this`)

**Otherwise:** Longer code (in ES5 functions) is more prone to bugs and cumbersome to read


<br/><br/><br/>

<p align="right"><a href="#table-of-contents">⬆ Return to top</a></p>

# `4. Testing And Overall Quality Practices`

## ![✔] 4.1 At the very least, write API (component) testing

**TL;DR:** Most projects just don't have any automated testing due to short timetables or often the 'testing project' ran out of control and was abandoned. For that reason, prioritize and start with API testing which is the easiest way to write and provides more coverage than unit testing (you may even craft API tests without code using tools like [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)). Afterward, should you have more resources and time, continue with advanced test types like unit testing, DB testing, performance testing, etc

**Otherwise:** You may spend long days on writing unit tests to find out that you got only 20% system coverage

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 4.2 Include 3 parts in each test name

**TL;DR:** Make the test speak at the requirements level so it's self-explanatory also to QA engineers and developers who are not familiar with the code internals. State in the test name what is being tested (unit under test), under what circumstances, and what is the expected result

**Otherwise:** A deployment just failed, a test named “Add product” failed. Does this tell you what exactly is malfunctioning?

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 4.3 Structure tests by the AAA pattern

**TL;DR:** Structure your tests with 3 well-separated sections: Arrange, Act & Assert (AAA). The first part includes the test setup, then the execution of the unit under test, and finally the assertion phase. Following this structure guarantees that the reader spends no brain CPU on understanding the test plan

**Otherwise:** Not only you spend long daily hours on understanding the main code, but now also what should have been the simple part of the day (testing) stretches your brain

```
describe.skip('Customer classifier', () => {
    test('When customer spent more than 500$, should be classified as premium', () => {
        //Arrange
        const customerToClassify = {spent:505, joined: new Date(), id:1}
        const DBStub = sinon.stub(dataAccess, 'getCustomer')
            .reply({id:1, classification: 'regular'});

        //Act
        const receivedClassification = customerClassifier.classifyCustomer(customerToClassify);

        //Assert
        expect(receivedClassification).toMatch('premium');
    });
});
```

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 4.4 Detect code issues with a linter

**TL;DR:** Use a code linter to check the basic quality and detect anti-patterns early. Run it before any test and add it as a pre-commit git-hook to minimize the time needed to review and correct any issue. Also check [Section 3](#3-code-style-practices) on Code Style Practices

**Otherwise:** You may let pass some anti-pattern and possible vulnerable code to your production environment.

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 4.6 Constantly inspect for vulnerable dependencies

**TL;DR:** Even the most reputable dependencies such as Express have known vulnerabilities. This can get easily tamed using community and commercial tools such as 🔗 [npm audit](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/audit) and 🔗 [snyk.io](https://snyk.io) that can be invoked from your CI on every build

**Otherwise:** Keeping your code clean from vulnerabilities without dedicated tools will require to constantly follow online publications about new threats. Quite tedious

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 4.7 Tag your tests

**TL;DR:** Different tests must run on different scenarios: quick smoke, IO-less, tests should run when a developer saves or commits a file, full end-to-end tests usually run when a new pull request is submitted, etc. This can be achieved by tagging tests with keywords like #cold #api #sanity so you can grep with your testing harness and invoke the desired subset. For example, this is how you would invoke only the sanity test group with [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/): mocha --grep 'sanity'

**Otherwise:** Running all the tests, including tests that perform dozens of DB queries, any time a developer makes a small change can be extremely slow and keeps developers away from running tests

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 4.8 Check your test coverage, it helps to identify wrong test patterns

**TL;DR:** Code coverage tools like [Istanbul](https://github.com/istanbuljs/istanbuljs)/[NYC](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc) are great for 3 reasons: it comes for free (no effort is required to benefit this reports), it helps to identify a decrease in testing coverage, and last but not least it highlights testing mismatches: by looking at colored code coverage reports you may notice, for example, code areas that are never tested like catch clauses (meaning that tests only invoke the happy paths and not how the app behaves on errors). Set it to fail builds if the coverage falls under a certain threshold

**Otherwise:** There won't be any automated metric telling you when a large portion of your code is not covered by testing

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 4.9 Inspect for outdated packages

**TL;DR:** Use your preferred tool (e.g. `npm outdated` or [npm-check-updates](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates)) to detect installed outdated packages, inject this check into your CI pipeline and even make a build fail in a severe scenario. For example, a severe scenario might be when an installed package is 5 patch commits behind (e.g. local version is 1.3.1 and repository version is 1.3.8) or it is tagged as deprecated by its author - kill the build and prevent deploying this version

**Otherwise:** Your production will run packages that have been explicitly tagged by their author as risky

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 4.10 Use production-like environment for e2e testing

**TL;DR:** End to end (e2e) testing which includes live data used to be the weakest link of the CI process as it depends on multiple heavy services like DB. Use an environment which is as close to your real production environment as possible like a-continue (Missed -continue here, needs content. Judging by the **Otherwise** clause, this should mention docker-compose)

**Otherwise:** Without docker-compose, teams must maintain a testing DB for each testing environment including developers' machines, keep all those DBs in sync so test results won't vary across environments

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 4.11 Refactor regularly using static analysis tools

**TL;DR:** Using static analysis tools helps by giving objective ways to improve code quality and keeps your code maintainable. You can add static analysis tools to your CI build to fail when it finds code smells. Its main selling points over plain linting are the ability to inspect quality in the context of multiple files (e.g. detect duplications), perform advanced analysis (e.g. code complexity), and follow the history and progress of code issues. Two examples of tools you can use are [Sonarqube](https://www.sonarqube.org/) (2,600+ [stars](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonarqube)) and [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/) (1,500+ [stars](https://github.com/codeclimate/codeclimate)).

**Otherwise:** With poor code quality, bugs and performance will always be an issue that no shiny new library or state of the art features can fix

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 4.13 Test your middlewares in isolation

**TL;DR:** When a middleware holds some immense logic that spans many requests, it is worth testing it in isolation without waking up the entire web framework. This can be easily achieved by stubbing and spying on the {req, res, next} objects

**Otherwise:** A bug in Express middleware === a bug in all or most requests

<br/><br/><br/>

<p align="right"><a href="#table-of-contents">⬆ Return to top</a></p>

# `5. Going To Production Practices`

## ![✔] 5.1. Monitoring

**TL;DR:** Monitoring is a game of finding out issues before customers do – obviously this should be assigned unprecedented importance. The market is overwhelmed with offers thus consider starting with defining the basic metrics you must follow (my suggestions inside), then go over additional fancy features and choose the solution that ticks all boxes. Click ‘The Gist’ below for an overview of the solutions

**Otherwise:** Failure === disappointed customers. Simple

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 5.2. Increase transparency using smart logging

**TL;DR:** Logs can be a dumb warehouse of debug statements or the enabler of a beautiful dashboard that tells the story of your app. Plan your logging platform from day 1: how logs are collected, stored and analyzed to ensure that the desired information (e.g. error rate, following an entire transaction through services and servers, etc) can really be extracted

**Otherwise:** You end up with a black box that is hard to reason about, then you start re-writing all logging statements to add additional information

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 5.3. Delegate anything possible (e.g. gzip, SSL) to a reverse proxy

**TL;DR:** Node is awfully bad at doing CPU intensive tasks like gzipping, SSL termination, etc. You should use ‘real’ middleware services like nginx, HAproxy or cloud vendor services instead

**Otherwise:** Your poor single thread will stay busy doing infrastructural tasks instead of dealing with your application core and performance will degrade accordingly


<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 5.4. Lock dependencies

**TL;DR:** Your code must be identical across all environments, but amazingly npm lets dependencies drift across environments by default – when you install packages at various environments it tries to fetch packages’ latest patch version. Overcome this by using npm config files, .npmrc, that tell each environment to save the exact (not the latest) version of each package. Alternatively, for finer grained control use `npm shrinkwrap`. \*Update: as of NPM5, dependencies are locked by default. The new package manager in town, Yarn, also got us covered by default

**Otherwise:** QA will thoroughly test the code and approve a version that will behave differently in production. Even worse, different servers in the same production cluster might run different code

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 5.5. Guard process uptime using the right tool

**TL;DR:** The process must go on and get restarted upon failures. For simple scenarios, process management tools like PM2 might be enough but in today's ‘dockerized’ world, cluster management tools should be considered as well

**Otherwise:** Running dozens of instances without a clear strategy and too many tools together (cluster management, docker, PM2) might lead to DevOps chaos

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 5.6. Utilize all CPU cores

**TL;DR:** At its basic form, a Node app runs on a single CPU core while all others are left idling. It’s your duty to replicate the Node process and utilize all CPUs – For small-medium apps you may use Node Cluster or PM2. For a larger app consider replicating the process using some Docker cluster (e.g. K8S, ECS) or deployment scripts that are based on Linux init system (e.g. systemd)

**Otherwise:** Your app will likely utilize only 25% of its available resources(!) or even less. Note that a typical server has 4 CPU cores or more, naive deployment of Node.js utilizes only 1 (even using PaaS services like AWS beanstalk!)

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 5.7. Create a ‘maintenance endpoint’

**TL;DR:** Expose a set of system-related information, like memory usage and REPL, etc in a secured API. Although it’s highly recommended to rely on standard and battle-tested tools, some valuable information and operations are easier done using code

**Otherwise:** You’ll find that you’re performing many “diagnostic deploys” – shipping code to production only to extract some information for diagnostic purposes

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 5.8. Discover errors and downtime using APM products

**TL;DR:** Application monitoring and performance products (a.k.a. APM) proactively gauge codebase and API so they can auto-magically go beyond traditional monitoring and measure the overall user-experience across services and tiers. For example, some APM products can highlight a transaction that loads too slow on the end-user's side while suggesting the root cause

**Otherwise:** You might spend great effort on measuring API performance and downtimes, probably you’ll never be aware which is your slowest code parts under real-world scenario and how these affect the UX

<br/><br/>


## ![✔] 5.9. Measure and guard the memory usage

**TL;DR:** Node.js has controversial relationships with memory: the v8 engine has soft limits on memory usage (1.4GB) and there are known paths to leak memory in Node’s code – thus watching Node’s process memory is a must. In small apps, you may gauge memory periodically using shell commands but in medium-large apps consider baking your memory watch into a robust monitoring system

**Otherwise:** Your process memory might leak a hundred megabytes a day like how it happened at [Walmart](https://www.joyent.com/blog/walmart-node-js-memory-leak)

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 5.11. Get your frontend assets out of Node

**TL;DR:** Serve frontend content using dedicated middleware (nginx, S3, CDN) because Node performance really gets hurt when dealing with many static files due to its single-threaded model

**Otherwise:** Your single Node thread will be busy streaming hundreds of html/images/angular/react files instead of allocating all its resources for the task it was born for – serving dynamic content

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 5.12. Be stateless, kill your servers almost every day

**TL;DR:** Store any type of data (e.g. user sessions, cache, uploaded files) within external data stores. Consider ‘killing’ your servers periodically or use ‘serverless’ platform (e.g. AWS Lambda) that explicitly enforces a stateless behavior

**Otherwise:** Failure at a given server will result in application downtime instead of just killing a faulty machine. Moreover, scaling-out elasticity will get more challenging due to the reliance on a specific server

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 5.13. Use tools that automatically detect vulnerabilities

**TL;DR:** Even the most reputable dependencies such as Express have known vulnerabilities (from time to time) that can put a system at risk. This can be easily tamed using community and commercial tools that constantly check for vulnerabilities and warn (locally or at GitHub), some can even patch them immediately

**Otherwise:** Keeping your code clean from vulnerabilities without dedicated tools will require you to constantly follow online publications about new threats. Quite tedious

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 5.14. Assign a transaction id to each log statement

Also known as correlation id / transit id / tracing id / request id / request context / etc.

**TL;DR:** Assign the same identifier, transaction-id: {some value}, to each log entry within a single request. Then when inspecting errors in logs, easily conclude what happened before and after. Until version 14 of Node, this was not easy to achieve due to Node's async nature, but since AsyncLocalStorage came to town, this became possible and easy than ever. see code examples inside

**Otherwise:** Looking at a production error log without the context – what happened before – makes it much harder and slower to reason about the issue

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 5.15. Set `NODE_ENV=production`

**TL;DR:** Set the environment variable `NODE_ENV` to ‘production’ or ‘development’ to flag whether production optimizations should get activated – many npm packages determine the current environment and optimize their code for production

**Otherwise:** Omitting this simple property might greatly degrade performance. For example, when using Express for server-side rendering omitting `NODE_ENV` makes it slower by a factor of three!

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 5.16. Design automated, atomic and zero-downtime deployments

**TL;DR:** Research shows that teams who perform many deployments lower the probability of severe production issues. Fast and automated deployments that don’t require risky manual steps and service downtime significantly improve the deployment process. You should probably achieve this using Docker combined with CI tools as they became the industry standard for streamlined deployment

**Otherwise:** Long deployments -> production downtime & human-related error -> team unconfident in making deployment -> fewer deployments and features

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 5.17. Use an LTS release of Node.js

**TL;DR:** Ensure you are using an LTS version of Node.js to receive critical bug fixes, security updates and performance improvements

**Otherwise:** Newly discovered bugs or vulnerabilities could be used to exploit an application running in production, and your application may become unsupported by various modules and harder to maintain

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 5.18. Don't route logs within the app

**TL;DR:** Log destinations should not be hard-coded by developers within the application code, but instead should be defined by the execution environment the application runs in. Developers should write logs to `stdout` using a logger utility and then let the execution environment (container, server, etc.) pipe the `stdout` stream to the appropriate destination (i.e. Splunk, Graylog, ElasticSearch, etc.).

**Otherwise:** Application handling log routing === hard to scale, loss of logs, poor separation of concerns

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 5.19. Install your packages with `npm ci`

**TL;DR:** You have to be sure that production code uses the exact version of the packages you have tested it with. Run `npm ci` to strictly do a clean install of your dependencies matching package.json and package-lock.json. Using this command is recommended in automated environments such as continuous integration pipelines.

**Otherwise:** QA will thoroughly test the code and approve a version that will behave differently in production. Even worse, different servers in the same production cluster might run different code.

# `6. Security Best Practices`

## ![✔] 6.1. Limit concurrent requests using a middleware

<a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Denial_of_Service" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/%E2%9C%94%20OWASP%20Threats%20-%20DDOS%20-green.svg" alt=""/></a>

**TL;DR:** DOS attacks are very popular and relatively easy to conduct. Implement rate limiting using an external service such as cloud load balancers, cloud firewalls, nginx, [rate-limiter-flexible](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rate-limiter-flexible) package, or (for smaller and less critical apps) a rate-limiting middleware (e.g. [express-rate-limit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-rate-limit))

**Otherwise:** An application could be subject to an attack resulting in a denial of service where real users receive a degraded or unavailable service.

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 6.2 Extract secrets from config files or use packages to encrypt them

<a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A6-Security_Misconfiguration" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/%E2%9C%94%20OWASP%20Threats%20-%20A6:Security%20Misconfiguration%20-green.svg" alt=""/></a> <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A3-Sensitive_Data_Exposure" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/%E2%9C%94%20OWASP%20Threats%20-%20A3:Sensitive%20Data%20Exposure%20-green.svg" alt=""/></a>

**TL;DR:** Never store plain-text secrets in configuration files or source code. Instead, make use of secret-management systems like Vault products, Kubernetes/Docker Secrets, or using environment variables. As a last resort, secrets stored in source control must be encrypted and managed (rolling keys, expiring, auditing, etc). Make use of pre-commit/push hooks to prevent committing secrets accidentally

**Otherwise:** Source control, even for private repositories, can mistakenly be made public, at which point all secrets are exposed. Access to source control for an external party will inadvertently provide access to related systems (databases, apis, services, etc).

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 6.3. Prevent query injection vulnerabilities with ORM/ODM libraries

<a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A1-Injection" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/%E2%9C%94%20OWASP%20Threats%20-%20A1:Injection%20-green.svg" alt=""/></a>

**TL;DR:** To prevent SQL/NoSQL injection and other malicious attacks, always make use of an ORM/ODM or a database library that escapes data or supports named or indexed parameterized queries, and takes care of validating user input for expected types. Never just use JavaScript template strings or string concatenation to inject values into queries as this opens your application to a wide spectrum of vulnerabilities. All the reputable Node.js data access libraries (e.g. [Sequelize](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize), [Knex](https://github.com/tgriesser/knex), [mongoose](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose)) have built-in protection against injection attacks.

**Otherwise:** Unvalidated or unsanitized user input could lead to operator injection when working with MongoDB for NoSQL, and not using a proper sanitization system or ORM will easily allow SQL injection attacks, creating a giant vulnerability.

<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 6.5. Adjust the HTTP response headers for enhanced security

<a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A6-Security_Misconfiguration" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/%E2%9C%94%20OWASP%20Threats%20-%20A6:Security%20Misconfiguration%20-green.svg" alt=""/></a>

**TL;DR:** Your application should be using secure headers to prevent attackers from using common attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking and other malicious attacks. These can be configured easily using modules like [helmet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet).

**Otherwise:** Attackers could perform direct attacks on your application's users, leading to huge security vulnerabilities

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 6.6. Constantly and automatically inspect for vulnerable dependencies

<a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A9-Using_Components_with_Known_Vulnerabilities" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/%E2%9C%94%20OWASP%20Threats%20-%20A9:Known%20Vulnerabilities%20-green.svg" alt=""/></a>

**TL;DR:** With the npm ecosystem it is common to have many dependencies for a project. Dependencies should always be kept in check as new vulnerabilities are found. Use tools like [npm audit](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/audit) or [snyk](https://snyk.io/) to track, monitor and patch vulnerable dependencies. Integrate these tools with your CI setup so you catch a vulnerable dependency before it makes it to production.

**Otherwise:** An attacker could detect your web framework and attack all its known vulnerabilities.

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 6.8. Protect Users' Passwords/Secrets using bcrypt or scrypt

<a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A2-Broken_Authentication" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/%E2%9C%94%20OWASP%20Threats%20-%20A9:Broken%20Authentication%20-green.svg" alt=""/></a>

**TL;DR:** Passwords or secrets (e.g. API keys) should be stored using a secure hash + salt function like `bcrypt`,`scrypt`, or worst case `pbkdf2`.

**Otherwise:** Passwords and secrets that are stored without using a secure function are vulnerable to brute forcing and dictionary attacks that will lead to their disclosure eventually.

<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 6.9. Validate incoming JSON schemas

<a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A7-Cross-Site_Scripting_(XSS)" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/%E2%9C%94%20OWASP%20Threats%20-%20A7: XSS%20-green.svg" alt=""/></a> <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A8-Insecure_Deserialization" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/%E2%9C%94%20OWASP%20Threats%20-%20A8:Insecured%20Deserialization%20-green.svg" alt=""/></a>

**TL;DR:** Validate the incoming requests' body payload and ensure it meets expectations, fail fast if it doesn't. To avoid tedious validation coding within each route you may use lightweight JSON-based validation schemas such as [jsonschema](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonschema) or [joi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/joi)

**Otherwise:** Your generosity and permissive approach greatly increases the attack surface and encourages the attacker to try out many inputs until they find some combination to crash the application

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 6.10. Support blocklisting JWTs

<a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A2-Broken_Authentication" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/%E2%9C%94%20OWASP%20Threats%20-%20A9:Broken%20Authentication%20-green.svg" alt=""/></a>

**TL;DR:** When using JSON Web Tokens (for example, with [Passport.js](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport)), by default there's no mechanism to revoke access from issued tokens. Once you discover some malicious user activity, there's no way to stop them from accessing the system as long as they hold a valid token. Mitigate this by implementing a blocklist of untrusted tokens that are validated on each request.

**Otherwise:** Expired, or misplaced tokens could be used maliciously by a third party to access an application and impersonate the owner of the token.

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 6.11. Prevent brute-force attacks against authorization

<a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A2-Broken_Authentication" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/%E2%9C%94%20OWASP%20Threats%20-%20A9:Broken%20Authentication%20-green.svg" alt=""/></a>

**TL;DR:** A simple and powerful technique is to limit authorization attempts using two metrics:

1. The first is number of consecutive failed attempts by the same user unique ID/name and IP address.
2. The second is number of failed attempts from an IP address over some long period of time. For example, block an IP address if it makes 100 failed attempts in one day.

**Otherwise:** An attacker can issue unlimited automated password attempts to gain access to privileged accounts on an application

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 6.12. Run Node.js as non-root user

<a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A5-Broken_Access_Control" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/%E2%9C%94%20OWASP%20Threats%20-%20A5:Broken%20Access%20Access%20Control-green.svg" alt=""/></a>

**TL;DR:** There is a common scenario where Node.js runs as a root user with unlimited permissions. For example, this is the default behaviour in Docker containers. It's recommended to create a non-root user and either bake it into the Docker image (examples given below) or run the process on this user's behalf by invoking the container with the flag "-u username"

**Otherwise:** An attacker who manages to run a script on the server gets unlimited power over the local machine (e.g. change iptable and re-route traffic to their server)

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 6.13. Limit payload size using a reverse-proxy or a middleware

<a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A8-Insecure_Deserialization" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/%E2%9C%94%20OWASP%20Threats%20-%20A8:Insecured%20Deserialization%20-green.svg" alt=""/></a> <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A1-Injection" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/%E2%9C%94%20OWASP%20Threats%20-%20DDOS%20-green.svg" alt=""/></a>

**TL;DR:** The bigger the body payload is, the harder your single thread works in processing it. This is an opportunity for attackers to bring servers to their knees without tremendous amount of requests (DOS/DDOS attacks). Mitigate this limiting the body size of incoming requests on the edge (e.g. firewall, ELB) or by configuring [express body parser](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser) to accept only small-size payloads

**Otherwise:** Your application will have to deal with large requests, unable to process the other important work it has to accomplish, leading to performance implications and vulnerability towards DOS attacks

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 6.14. Avoid JavaScript eval statements

<a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A7-Cross-Site_Scripting_(XSS)" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/%E2%9C%94%20OWASP%20Threats%20-%20A7:XSS%20-green.svg" alt=""/></a> <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A1-Injection" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/%E2%9C%94%20OWASP%20Threats%20-%20A1:Injection%20-green.svg" alt=""/></a> <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A4-XML_External_Entities_(XXE)" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/%E2%9C%94%20OWASP%20Threats%20-%20A4:External%20Entities%20-green.svg" alt=""/></a>

**TL;DR:** `eval` is evil as it allows executing custom JavaScript code during run time. This is not just a performance concern but also an important security concern due to malicious JavaScript code that may be sourced from user input. Another language feature that should be avoided is `new Function` constructor. `setTimeout` and `setInterval` should never be passed dynamic JavaScript code either.

**Otherwise:** Malicious JavaScript code finds a way into text passed into `eval` or other real-time evaluating JavaScript language functions, and will gain complete access to JavaScript permissions on the page. This vulnerability is often manifested as an XSS attack.

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 6.15. Prevent evil RegEx from overloading your single thread execution

<a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Denial_of_Service" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/%E2%9C%94%20OWASP%20Threats%20-%20DDOS%20-green.svg" alt=""/></a>

**TL;DR:** Regular Expressions, while being handy, pose a real threat to JavaScript applications at large, and the Node.js platform in particular. A user input for text to match might require an outstanding amount of CPU cycles to process. RegEx processing might be inefficient to an extent that a single request that validates 10 words can block the entire event loop for 6 seconds and set the CPU on 🔥. For that reason, prefer third-party validation packages like [validator.js](https://github.com/chriso/validator.js) instead of writing your own Regex patterns, or make use of [safe-regex](https://github.com/substack/safe-regex) to detect vulnerable regex patterns

**Otherwise:** Poorly written regexes could be susceptible to Regular Expression DoS attacks that will block the event loop completely. For example, the popular `moment` package was found vulnerable with malicious RegEx usage in November of 2017

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 6.16. Avoid module loading using a variable

<a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A7-Cross-Site_Scripting_(XSS)" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/%E2%9C%94%20OWASP%20Threats%20-%20A7:XSS%20-green.svg" alt=""/></a> <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A1-Injection" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/%E2%9C%94%20OWASP%20Threats%20-%20A1:Injection%20-green.svg" alt=""/></a> <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A4-XML_External_Entities_(XXE)" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/%E2%9C%94%20OWASP%20Threats%20-%20A4:External%20Entities%20-green.svg" alt=""/></a>

**TL;DR:** Avoid requiring/importing another file with a path that was given as parameter due to the concern that it could have originated from user input. This rule can be extended for accessing files in general (i.e. `fs.readFile()`) or other sensitive resource access with dynamic variables originating from user input. [Eslint-plugin-security](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-security) linter can catch such patterns and warn early enough

**Otherwise:** Malicious user input could find its way to a parameter that is used to require tampered files, for example, a previously uploaded file on the file system, or access already existing system files.

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 6.17. Configure 2FA for npm or Yarn

<a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A6-Security_Misconfiguration" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/%E2%9C%94%20OWASP%20Threats%20-%20A6:Security%20Misconfiguration%20-green.svg" alt=""/></a>

**TL;DR:** Any step in the development chain should be protected with MFA (multi-factor authentication), npm/Yarn are a sweet opportunity for attackers who can get their hands on some developer's password. Using developer credentials, attackers can inject malicious code into libraries that are widely installed across projects and services. Maybe even across the web if published in public. Enabling 2-factor-authentication in npm leaves almost zero chances for attackers to alter your package code.

**Otherwise:** [Have you heard about the eslint developer whose password was hijacked?](https://medium.com/@oprearocks/eslint-backdoor-what-it-is-and-how-to-fix-the-issue-221f58f1a8c8)

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 6.18. Modify session middleware settings

<a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A6-Security_Misconfiguration" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/%E2%9C%94%20OWASP%20Threats%20-%20A6:Security%20Misconfiguration%20-green.svg" alt=""/></a>

**TL;DR:** Each web framework and technology has its known weaknesses - telling an attacker which web framework we use is a great help for them. Using the default settings for session middlewares can expose your app to module- and framework-specific hijacking attacks in a similar way to the `X-Powered-By` header. Try hiding anything that identifies and reveals your tech stack (E.g. Node.js, express)

**Otherwise:** Cookies could be sent over insecure connections, and an attacker might use session identification to identify the underlying framework of the web application, as well as module-specific vulnerabilities

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 6.19. Prevent unsafe redirects

<a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A1-Injection" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/%E2%9C%94%20OWASP%20Threats%20-%20A1:Injection%20-green.svg" alt=""/></a>

**TL;DR:** Redirects that do not validate user input can enable attackers to launch phishing scams, steal user credentials, and perform other malicious actions.

**Otherwise:** If an attacker discovers that you are not validating external, user-supplied input, they may exploit this vulnerability by posting specially-crafted links on forums, social media, and other public places to get users to click it.


<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 6.20. Avoid publishing secrets to the npm registry

<a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A6-Security_Misconfiguration" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/%E2%9C%94%20OWASP%20Threats%20-%20A6:Security%20Misconfiguration%20-green.svg" alt=""/></a>

**TL;DR:** Precautions should be taken to avoid the risk of accidentally publishing secrets to public npm registries. An `.npmignore` file can be used to ignore specific files or folders, or the `files` array in `package.json` can act as an allow list.

**Otherwise:** Your project's API keys, passwords or other secrets are open to be abused by anyone who comes across them, which may result in financial loss, impersonation, and other risks.

# `7. Draft: Performance Best Practices`

## Our contributors are working on this section. [Would you like to join?](https://github.com/goldbergyoni/nodebestpractices/issues/256)

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 7.1. Don't block the event loop

**TL;DR:** Avoid CPU intensive tasks as they will block the mostly single-threaded Event Loop and offload those to a dedicated thread, process or even a different technology based on the context.

**Otherwise:** As the Event Loop is blocked, Node.js will be unable to handle other request thus causing delays for concurrent users. **3000 users are waiting for a response, the content is ready to be served, but one single request blocks the server from dispatching the results back**

<br /><br /><br />

## ![✔] 7.2. Prefer native JS methods over user-land utils like Lodash

**TL;DR:** It's often more penalising to use utility libraries like `lodash` and `underscore` over native methods as it leads to unneeded dependencies and slower performance.
Bear in mind that with the introduction of the new V8 engine alongside the new ES standards, native methods were improved in such a way that it's now about 50% more performant than utility libraries.

**Otherwise:** You'll have to maintain less performant projects where you could have simply used what was **already** available or dealt with a few more lines in exchange of a few more files.
